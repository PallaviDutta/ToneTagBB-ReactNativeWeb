#### Do you want to create a web app and, at the same time, a native app for Android and iOS with only one source code?It could work with the help of React Native Web library.

How to run and test all: iOS, Android and Web platform?

1. Run native server:

yarn start

2. Open a new terminal tab and run XCode Simulator with our new iOS app:

yarn run ios

(Now you should see your app running on iOS.)

3. Open an Android emulator (Android Studio > AVD Manager)When the Android emulator is ready, run our new Android app:

yarn run android

(Now you should see your app running on Android.)

4. Finally, run also the web app:
